# Trade Analysis Framework

How to go from "I just read something" to "here's the trade." This is the analytical
engine behind the skill.

## The Analysis Stack

Work through these layers in order. Each layer builds on the previous one.

### Layer 1: What Actually Happened?

Before trading the news, make sure you understand the news.

- **Strip the spin.** Headlines are written for clicks, not accuracy. What's the
  actual factual content underneath the framing?
- **Source credibility.** Is this a Reuters report or a random anon tweet? Adjust
  conviction accordingly.
- **Is this confirmed or speculative?** "X is considering Y" is very different from
  "X announced Y." Trade the probability, not the certainty.
- **Is this new information?** If this was reported 3 days ago and you're just seeing
  it now, the trade may already be done.

### Layer 2: First-Order Effects (The Obvious Trade)

Who directly benefits or gets hurt?

- **Direct beneficiary:** The company/protocol/asset explicitly mentioned favorably
- **Direct casualty:** The entity being regulated, sued, hacked, or disrupted
- **Sector read-across:** If one company in a sector gets good news, the whole sector
  often moves (especially in crypto where correlation is high)

**Warning:** The first-order trade is usually the most crowded. It's where you start
the analysis, not where you finish.

### Layer 3: Second-Order Effects (Where the Alpha Is)

This is the meat. Ask these questions:

#### Supply Chain Logic
- If X benefits, who supplies X with critical inputs?
- If X gets hurt, who loses their biggest customer?
- If X grows, what infrastructure does X need more of?

#### Substitution Logic
- If X gets regulated/banned, what's the closest substitute?
- If X becomes expensive, what's the cheaper alternative?
- If X fails, where do its users/customers/TVL migrate?

#### Rotation Logic
- If money flows into X, where does it flow from?
- If attention goes to X, what gets ignored (potential dip buy later)?
- If X narrative strengthens, what opposing narrative weakens?

#### Reflexivity Logic
- If everyone buys X because of this news, does the buying itself change the fundamentals?
- Does the trade, if crowded, create the conditions for its own reversal?
- Is there a feedback loop (positive or negative)?

#### Narrative Logic
- Does this news start a new narrative or accelerate an existing one?
- Is this the first domino in a sequence of catalysts?
- Does this news kill a narrative that was supporting certain assets?

### Layer 4: Timeframe Separation

The same news can produce opposite trades at different timeframes:

| Timeframe | Question | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Immediate (0-24h)** | What's the knee-jerk reaction? | News drops → panic sell → bounce |
| **Short-term (days-weeks)** | What's the positioning trade? | Funds rebalance, narratives form |
| **Medium-term (weeks-months)** | What are the structural implications? | Regulation creates moat for compliant players |
| **Secular (months-years)** | Does this change the long-term thesis? | Technology shift, permanent market structure change |

**Common pattern:** The immediate trade is often the opposite of the medium-term trade.
Panic selling on news creates entry points for the structural trade.

### Layer 5: Conviction Assessment

Rate your conviction honestly:

**High conviction requires ALL of:**
- Clear, confirmed catalyst (not rumor)
- Identifiable beneficiary with liquid market
- Narrative tailwind (market WANTS to believe this story)
- Not yet fully priced in (check if the asset already moved)

**Medium conviction — missing one of:**
- Catalyst is ambiguous or unconfirmed
- Beneficiary is clear but market is already positioned
- Narrative exists but is getting crowded
- Thesis is sound but timing is unclear

**Low conviction — speculative:**
- Based on inference, not direct causation
- Depends on follow-through that may not happen
- Market may not care (not everything is tradeable)
- Multiple conflicting interpretations

## News Category Playbooks

### Macro/Policy
- **Think:** Rate expectations, dollar strength, liquidity conditions
- **Key question:** Does this expand or contract global liquidity?
- **Typical flow:** Policy → rates → dollar → risk assets → crypto
- **Watch for:** Second-order effects through currency markets

### Regulatory
- **Think:** Who gets cleared, who gets targeted, what new markets open
- **Key question:** Does this create clarity (bullish) or uncertainty (bearish)?
- **Typical flow:** Regulation → compliance costs → winners/losers split
- **Watch for:** The "picks and shovels" — compliance tools, legal infrastructure

### Tech/Infrastructure
- **Think:** What new use cases does this enable? What becomes obsolete?
- **Key question:** Does this improve UX enough to drive adoption?
- **Typical flow:** Tech upgrade → new capabilities → new narratives → new tokens
- **Watch for:** The gap between announcement and actual deployment

### Social/Cultural
- **Think:** Attention flows, narrative momentum, reflexive loops
- **Key question:** Does this bring new participants into the market?
- **Typical flow:** Viral moment → attention → FOMO → liquidity spike → narrative
- **Watch for:** The decay rate — social catalysts have short half-lives

### On-Chain/Data
- **Think:** Smart money positioning, supply dynamics, network health
- **Key question:** Is this organic or manipulated? Trend or one-off?
- **Typical flow:** On-chain signal → thesis → positioning → price follows
- **Watch for:** Confirmation bias — don't trade a single data point

### Black Swan / Crisis
- **Think:** Contagion risk, confidence effects, forced selling
- **Key question:** Is this contained or does it spread?
- **Typical flow:** Event → panic → contagion assessment → recovery or death spiral
- **Watch for:** The assets that DON'T drop — they're showing relative strength

## Anti-Patterns (Common Mistakes)

1. **Trading the headline, not the story.** Headlines are designed to provoke, not inform.
   Always dig one level deeper.
2. **Ignoring positioning.** If everyone is already long X, even good news might not move
   X higher. "Buy the rumor, sell the news" exists for a reason.
3. **Confusing correlation with causation.** Just because A and B moved together last time
   doesn't mean the same catalyst will produce the same correlation.
4. **Single-timeframe thinking.** Bullish on the 4h chart, bearish on the daily. Know
   which timeframe your trade operates on.
5. **Narrative without catalyst.** A narrative needs fresh catalysts to keep moving.
   "AI is the future" isn't a trade — "specific company just shipped AI product that
   changes X" is a trade.
6. **Trading noise.** Not every piece of news requires a trade. Sometimes the best
   analysis is "this doesn't matter."
